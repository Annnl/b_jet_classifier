This experimental high energy physics research uses TensorFlow framework to build two b-jet origin classifiers specifically for tt¯
production in association with additional b-jets and electron and a muon of the opposite charges
in the final state in pp collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV using the
ATLAS Run2 data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb^−1. After selecting
events to suppress irrelevant background, Monte Carlo simulation of discriminative variables
from Powheg + Pythia8 MC generated tt¯ events are used to train classifiers. We develop two
classifiers separately, one for exactly three b-jets and one for at least 4 b-jets in the final state.
Besides loss and accuracy, we estimate the two neural networks by efficiencies of four categories
of b-jets: leading and sub-leading pT b-jets from top quark quarks decays, and leading and
sub-leading (if present) pT additional b-jets.
